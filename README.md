# **Micrograd**

this repo is based on the tutorial by [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&t=6109s)
**What I learnt about:**
- defining what is a neuron in the context of deep learning
- defining a Value datatype
- addding functionality and interfaces to the Value datatype
- defining and applying backpropagation
- drawing out the networks using [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- create a neuron
- making a multi-layer perceptron out of the neuron
- using a custom built dataset and forwarding it throught the perceptron
- learning about the loss function, activation function and stochastic gradient descent
- how machine learning libraries like [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) work
- basics on how to work with neural networks
